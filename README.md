# MIX-EUP

Heavily modified ELS resource based of [MISS-ELS]() for the [MIX RP](https://servers.fivem.net/servers/detail/g5xpkm) FiveM server. 

- Added OneSync infinity support.
- Modified to mimic real life Dutch emergency lighting systems.
- Added "Modiforce" interface to control lighting.

## VCF Format

This resource is still fully compatible with the MISS-ELS configurator https://matsn0w.github.io/MISS-ELS/
